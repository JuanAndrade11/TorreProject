# Torre:SS (Success Stories)
Software Developer position Torre test

Torre SS is a companion web page where you can share your success stories with other users. This will work as a coaching or mentoring site where anyone can learn from other's experiences in real life projects, while also accesing to opportunities (in Torre) related to these posts.

People can create their users or login with their Google accounts. only then you can post a story. Posts can be liked by any logged in user. Posts can also be edited and deleted only by the creator. In each post there is a link that will redirect users to Torre's search page with opportunities related to the post tags. I wanted to implement NLP to get keywords from the post description, this was a new topic for me, I started the implementation but end up using tags (you can find more info about this in my trello dashboard).

To create this app I used a MERN environment with reducers, containers, models, etc.
